### Release
Our project uses [Tauri Bundler](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/tooling/bundler) for packaging of various platforms. Thank you very much for the Tauri teamâ€™s contribution to the Rust community.

You can use the following command to package the program:
```bash
cargo xtask release
```

help:
```bash
xtask release
  Release local native

  OPTIONS:
    -v, --version <version>
      You can specify a version
```

If you do not set the version number, output the version according to the version of the xtask package.

At present, the dmg format of the mac platform will be a bit problematic on my computer, so I commented it out in the `package_types` of `localnative-rs/xtask/src/release.rs`, if you want to try whether it can be packaged normally on your computer, It can be restored. In the current packager, the `mis` package language under windows is set to Chinese, you can change it according to your own language, and then package it later.
